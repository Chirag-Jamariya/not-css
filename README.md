## üéØ Why SoundCircle?
As there aren't many websites where you can see the top 10 globally streaming songs as well as your own top 10 songs and see the details like album name, genre, artist name, album cover and lastly lyrics. Our website brings all features together providing the user with a complete user experience.



## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
- Uses spotify API to get the top 10 globally streamed songs as well as user top 10 songs.
- Uses genius API  to get the info about the song in the query

## üß† Challenges
- Authentication for spotify
- To optimize the interaction between the 2 APIs
- To get the data from the API and display it in the front-end
